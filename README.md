# consoleVideo
An ASCII video maker for Python.

## Dependencies

In order to use this program, you will need:
* opencv-python
* Pillow

Or using pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to use it

First you'll need a video file (Preferably .mp4), then give its path to the first option.  
If the video file is in the same directory, just type it like this: example.mp4  
After it's done creating the frames, load them to the program with the second option.  
Finally, you'll be able to use the third option, which will ask for a desired speed (In seconds)  
This last parameter will depend on your need, but 0.014 seems to work for me.
